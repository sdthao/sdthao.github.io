                    <h1 style="font-size: 3vw;">Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
                    <p style="font-size: 1vw;">This is my very first web development project! I have always loved to explore the creative side of me that I do not get to utilize often. Mostly due to self criticism. However, I really enjoyed this project and hopefully it  boosts my confidence to share more content as I dive into the world of web development. I am currently pursing a Computer Science degree in hopes to one day become a Full Stack Developer. Here I will share photos of some of the things that interest me. Every photo has it's story, it can remind you of something in past or it can make you feel a certain way. As I see every photo, it brings me back to that point in time. I remember exactly the events that took place before the photo and how I was feeling during each photo. They all hold a special place in my heart. I am extremely grateful to be able to have seen all of the amazing places I got to see, and especially happy that I got to experience it with my partner. <strong>I hope that you've enjoyed seeing these photos!</strong> </p>
