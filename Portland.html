                                <p> Built in 1890, Cape Meares Lighthouse sits atop a cliff off the Oregon coast. Surrounded by a beautiful landscape with lush green tress on one side, and the Oregon coast on the other, this place was a breath-taking. </p>

                                <p> Cape Meares Lighthouse first lit in 1890. It served as the light station for Tillamook Bay for 124 years. It's amazing to see how good of a condition the bulb still was. I'm certain this lighthouse is still capable to perform it's duty. </p>

                                <p> Multnomah Falls is Oregon's tallest waterfall standing at 620' tall. Just off of the Colombia River Highway, this magical waterfall gushes through two tiers of basalt cliffs, feeding directly into the Colombia River. The area is also available during the winter as tourist flock to this place to see this beautiful waterfall frozen in time.  </p>

Some of the hikes in this park can get challenging and long. It didn't matter where we would end up however, we were just blown away by the sheer beauty of this forrest.</p>
